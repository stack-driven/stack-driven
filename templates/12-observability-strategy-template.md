# Observability Strategy

> **Generated**: [Date]
> **Product**: [Product Name]
> **Status**: [Draft/In Progress/Implemented]

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive observability strategy including metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, alerts, SLOs, and incident response.

**The Three Pillars**:
- **Metrics**: What is happening (numbers, trends)
- **Logs**: Why it's happening (events, context)
- **Traces**: Where it's happening (distributed systems)

---

## Observability Philosophy

### Principles

1. **Observe symptoms, not causes**: Alert on user impact, not CPU usage
2. **SLOs over SLAs**: Define reliability with error budgets
3. **Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) > Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: Fail fast, recover faster
4. **Actionable alerts**: Every alert must have a runbook
5. **Context over volume**: High signal, low noise

### Goals

**What we want to achieve**:
1. [Goal 1 - e.g., "Detect issues before customers report them"]
2. [Goal 2 - e.g., "Reduce MTTR from [X] to [Y] minutes"]
3. [Goal 3 - e.g., "99.9% uptime with < 5 min to detect incidents"]

---

## Golden Signals

**For each service, track these four signals**:

### 1. Latency
*How long does it take to service a request?*

| Service | Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| API | p50 response time | < 100ms | > 200ms |
| API | p95 response time | < 300ms | > 500ms |
| API | p99 response time | < 1000ms | > 2000ms |
| Database | Query time p95 | < 50ms | > 100ms |
| Frontend | Page load time p95 | < 2000ms | > 4000ms |

### 2. Traffic
*How much demand is being placed on your system?*

| Service | Metric | Baseline | Alert Threshold |
|---------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| API | Requests per second | [X] rps | < 10% of baseline or > 300% |
| API | Active connections | [Y] | > [max capacity] |
| Database | Queries per second | [Z] qps | > 80% of capacity |

### 3. Errors
*What is the rate of failed requests?*

| Service | Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| API | Error rate (5xx) | < 0.1% | > 1% |
| API | Client error rate (4xx) | < 5% | > 10% |
| Database | Connection errors | 0 | > 5 errors/min |
| Third-party | API call failures | < 1% | > 5% |

### 4. Saturation
*How full is your service?*

| Service | Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| CPU | Utilization | < 70% avg | > 85% for 5 min |
| Memory | Utilization | < 80% | > 90% |
| Disk | Utilization | < 80% | > 90% |
| Database | Connection pool | < 70% | > 90% |
| Queue | Depth | < 100 | > 1000 |

---

## Logging Strategy

### What to Log

**Application logs**:
- ✅ User actions (login, core actions)
- ✅ Errors and exceptions
- ✅ Performance bottlenecks
- ✅ Security events (auth failures, access denied)
- ✅ Business events (subscriptions, payments)

**Infrastructure logs**:
- ✅ Server start/stop
- ✅ Deployment events
- ✅ Configuration changes
- ✅ Health check results

**What NOT to log**:
- ❌ Passwords or credentials
- ❌ Credit card numbers
- ❌ Personal identification numbers
- ❌ User-generated content (PII)

---

### Log Format

**Structured logging** (JSON format):

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:00.123Z",
  "level": "error",
  "service": "api",
  "environment": "production",
  "request_id": "req_abc123",
  "user_id": "usr_xyz789",
  "message": "Database connection failed",
  "error": {
    "type": "DatabaseConnectionError",
    "message": "Connection timeout after 5000ms",
    "stack": "..."
  },
  "context": {
    "endpoint": "/api/users",
    "method": "GET",
    "ip": "192.168.1.1"
  }
}
```

**Standard fields** (every log):
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 format
- `level`: debug, info, warn, error, fatal
- `service`: Which service generated this
- `environment`: dev, staging, production
- `request_id`: Trace requests across services
- `user_id`: Associate with user (if applicable)
- `message`: Human-readable description

---

### Log Levels

**When to use each level**:

| Level | When to Use | Example | Goes to Alert? |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **DEBUG** | Detailed diagnostic info | "Query took 45ms" | No |
| **INFO** | General informational messages | "User logged in" | No |
| **WARN** | Potential issues, recoverable | "Retry attempt 2/3" | No |
| **ERROR** | Error occurred, user impacted | "Payment failed" | Yes (if frequent) |
| **FATAL** | System crash, immediate action | "Database unreachable" | Yes (always) |

---

### Log Retention

| Environment | Retention Period | Reason |
|-------------|------------------|--------|
| Production | 30 days hot, 90 days cold | Compliance, debugging |
| Staging | 7 days | Cost optimization |
| Development | 3 days | Cost optimization |

**Cost estimate**: $[X]/month at [Y] GB/day

---

## Distributed Tracing

### When to Use Tracing

**Use tracing for**:
- Multi-service requests (microservices)
- Complex workflows (many steps)
- Performance debugging (where's the slowdown?)

**Don't need tracing for**:
- Monolithic apps (logs sufficient)
- Simple request/response (metrics sufficient)

---

### Trace Implementation

**Tool**: [Jaeger / Zipkin / AWS X-Ray / OpenTelemetry]

**Sampling strategy**:
- **100% of errors**: Always trace failed requests
- **10% of successful requests**: Sample successes to reduce cost
- **100% of slow requests** (> 2s): Always trace slow requests

**Example trace**:

```
Request: GET /api/orders/123
├─ API Gateway (5ms)
├─ Auth Service (15ms)
│  └─ Redis lookup (3ms)
├─ Order Service (150ms)
│  ├─ Database query (100ms) ← SLOWEST
│  ├─ Inventory Service (30ms)
│  └─ User Service (20ms)
└─ Response (5ms)

Total: 175ms
```

**What to trace**:
- HTTP requests
- Database queries
- Cache lookups
- External API calls
- Message queue operations

---

## Metrics Architecture

### Metrics Collection

**Approach**: [RED method / USE method]

#### RED Method (for services)
*Recommended for request-driven services*

- **Rate**: Requests per second
- **Errors**: Requests that fail
- **Duration**: Time to complete requests

#### USE Method (for resources)
*Recommended for infrastructure*

- **Utilization**: % of resource used
- **Saturation**: Degree of overload
- **Errors**: Count of error events

---

### Custom Metrics

**Business metrics**:
```javascript
// Example: Track signups
metrics.increment('user.signup', 1, {
  source: 'organic',
  plan: 'pro'
});

// Example: Track revenue
metrics.gauge('revenue.mrr', 50000, {
  currency: 'USD'
});
```

**Product metrics**:
```javascript
// Example: Track feature usage
metrics.increment('feature.used', 1, {
  feature: 'export',
  format: 'csv'
});
```

**Performance metrics**:
```javascript
// Example: Track function duration
const start = Date.now();
await performExpensiveOperation();
const duration = Date.now() - start;
metrics.timing('operation.duration', duration, {
  operation: 'expensive_task'
});
```

---

### Metrics Aggregation

**Time windows**:
- Real-time: 1-minute buckets
- Short-term: 5-minute buckets
- Medium-term: 1-hour buckets
- Long-term: 1-day buckets

**Retention**:
- 1-min data: 24 hours
- 5-min data: 7 days
- 1-hour data: 90 days
- 1-day data: 2 years

---

## SLOs and Error Budgets

### Service Level Objectives

**What is an SLO?**
- Target reliability level (e.g., 99.9% uptime)
- Measured over a time window (e.g., 30 days)
- Creates an error budget (allowable downtime)

---

### SLO 1: API Availability

**Definition**: API returns 200/300 responses (not 500s)

**Target**: 99.9% of requests succeed

**Measurement window**: 30 days

**Error budget**: 0.1% failure rate = 43.2 minutes downtime/month

**Current performance**: [X%]

**Error budget remaining**: [Y] minutes this month

**What happens when budget exhausted**:
- Stop all feature work
- Focus on reliability improvements
- No deploys except bug fixes

---

### SLO 2: API Latency

**Definition**: API responds within acceptable time

**Target**: 95% of requests < 500ms (p95 latency)

**Measurement window**: 30 days

**Error budget**: 5% of requests can be > 500ms

**Current performance**: p95 = [X]ms

**Error budget remaining**: [Y]% slow requests allowed this month

---

### SLO 3: Critical User Flow Success Rate

**Definition**: Users can complete [core action]

**Target**: 99% of attempts succeed

**Measurement window**: 7 days

**Error budget**: 1% failure rate

**Current performance**: [X%] success

**Error budget remaining**: [Y]% failures allowed this week

---

### Error Budget Policy

**When error budget is healthy** (> 50% remaining):
- ✅ Ship new features
- ✅ Deploy to production multiple times/day
- ✅ Take calculated risks

**When error budget is low** (< 20% remaining):
- ⚠️ Slow down feature releases
- ⚠️ Increase testing
- ⚠️ Focus on stability

**When error budget is exhausted** (0% remaining):
- 🛑 Feature freeze
- 🛑 Only reliability improvements
- 🛑 Post-mortem required

---

## On-Call Runbooks

### Runbook Template

Each runbook should include:
1. **Symptoms**: What you're seeing (alerts, user reports)
2. **Diagnosis**: How to confirm the issue
3. **Fix**: Step-by-step resolution
4. **Prevention**: How to prevent recurrence
5. **Escalation**: When to escalate, who to contact

---

### Runbook 1: High Error Rate

**Symptoms**:
- Alert: "Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes"
- Users reporting errors
- Error tracking shows spike

**Diagnosis**:

1. Check error rate dashboard (which errors?)
2. Check logs for common error messages:
   ```bash
   # Search logs for errors in last 10 minutes
   kubectl logs -l app=api --since=10m | grep ERROR
   ```
3. Check recent deployments (did we just deploy?)
4. Check third-party status pages (is Stripe down?)

**Fix**:

**If caused by recent deployment**:
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api-deployment

# Verify error rate returns to normal
# Check dashboard after 5 minutes
```

**If caused by bad data**:
```bash
# Fix data issue
# Example: Remove invalid records
DELETE FROM users WHERE email IS NULL;

# Verify errors stop
```

**If caused by third-party outage**:
```bash
# Enable feature flag to disable feature
featureFlags.disable('stripe-payments');

# Or: Add circuit breaker to fail fast
```

**Prevention**:
- Add more comprehensive tests
- Improve staging environment to catch before prod
- Add gradual rollout (canary deployment)

**Escalation**:
- If unable to resolve in 15 minutes → escalate to senior engineer
- If data corruption → escalate to data team
- If third-party → check status page, contact their support if needed

---

### Runbook 2: API Down

**Symptoms**:
- Alert: "Health check failing"
- Users can't access application
- All requests timing out

**Diagnosis**:

1. Check if service is running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -l app=api

   # Are pods in "Running" state?
   # Are there any "CrashLoopBackOff"?
   ```

2. Check service logs:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -l app=api --tail=100

   # Look for errors on startup
   ```

3. Check recent changes:
   - Recent deployments?
   - Infrastructure changes?
   - Database migrations?

**Fix**:

**If pods are crashing**:
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl describe pod [pod-name]

# Common issues:
# - Out of memory → increase memory limit
# - Failed health check → check health endpoint
# - Image pull error → check image tag

# Quick fix: Rollback deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api-deployment
```

**If database is down**:
```bash
# Check database status
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier [name]

# If down, check AWS console for details
# May need to restore from backup
```

**If infrastructure issue**:
```bash
# Check AWS/GCP status page
# Check networking (security groups, VPC)
# Escalate to platform team
```

**Prevention**:
- Implement proper health checks
- Add resource limits and requests
- Set up auto-restart policies
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability

**Escalation**:
- If unable to restart service in 10 minutes → escalate to platform team
- If database issue → escalate to database admin
- If cloud provider outage → wait for status updates, communicate to users

## Incident Response Process

### Incident Severity

| Severity | Definition | Example | Response Time |
|----------|------------|---------|---------------|
| **SEV-1** | Complete outage, all users affected | API down, database down | Immediate (< 5 min) |
| **SEV-2** | Significant degradation, many users affected | High error rate, slow performance | 15 minutes |
| **SEV-3** | Minor issue, few users affected | Feature broken, UI bug | 1 hour |

---

### Incident Response Steps

#### 1. Detect (0-5 minutes)

**How incidents are detected**:
- Monitoring alerts (automated)
- User reports (support tickets)
- Team member notices (manual)

**First actions**:
- [ ] Acknowledge alert in PagerDuty
- [ ] Triage severity (SEV-1, 2, or 3)
- [ ] Create incident in incident management tool

---

#### 2. Communicate (5-10 minutes)

**Internal communication**:
- [ ] Post in #incidents Slack channel:
  ```
  🔴 INCIDENT: [Title]
  Severity: SEV-2
  Impact: [What's broken?]
  Investigating: @engineer
  Status page: [Link if public]
  ```
- [ ] Assign incident commander (for SEV-1)
- [ ] Loop in relevant teams

**External communication** (if customer-facing):
- [ ] Update status page: "Investigating"
- [ ] If SEV-1: Consider email to affected customers

---

#### 3. Diagnose (10-20 minutes)

**Diagnosis steps**:
- [ ] Check dashboards (errors, latency, traffic)
- [ ] Check logs (what errors are occurring?)
- [ ] Check recent changes (deployments, config, migrations)
- [ ] Check dependencies (third-party services, database)
- [ ] Follow runbook for this issue

**Document findings** in #incidents thread

---

#### 4. Fix (20-45 minutes)

**Resolution approaches**:
- **Rollback**: Deploy previous version (fastest)
- **Hotfix**: Fix the bug and deploy (if quick)
- **Disable feature**: Use feature flag to turn off broken feature
- **Scale up**: Add more resources if capacity issue
- **Wait**: If third-party outage, wait for their resolution

**Actions**:
- [ ] Execute fix
- [ ] Verify fix (check dashboards, test manually)
- [ ] Confirm error rate returns to normal
- [ ] Confirm latency returns to normal

---

#### 5. Monitor (45-60 minutes)

**Post-fix monitoring**:
- [ ] Watch dashboards for 15-30 minutes
- [ ] Ensure no new issues arise
- [ ] Check for customer reports (support tickets)

**Communication**:
- [ ] Update #incidents: "Resolved"
- [ ] Update status page: "Resolved"
- [ ] If customer impact: Send resolution email

---

#### 6. Post-Mortem (Within 48 hours)

**For SEV-1 and SEV-2 incidents**:
- [ ] Schedule post-mortem meeting (within 48 hours)
- [ ] Write post-mortem document (template below)
- [ ] Share with team for review
- [ ] Create action items to prevent recurrence
- [ ] Assign owners and due dates

---
