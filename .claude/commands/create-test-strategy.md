---

# Create Test Strategy (Session 9)

You are helping the user create a comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, test coverage goals, testing frameworks, CI/CD integration, test data management, performance testing, and security testing. This happens after defining database schema (Session 7) and API contracts (Session 8), but BEFORE generating the backlog, so that backlog items can be informed by the testing approach and quality gates.

## When to Use This

**This is Session 9** in the core Stack-Driven cascade. Run it:
- After Session 8 (`/generate-api-contracts` - API surface)
- Before Session 10 (`/generate-backlog` - implementation planning)
- When you need to define testing strategy based on journey, architecture, database, and APIs

**Skip this** if:
- You're pre-MVP and validating quickly (test later)
- You have a QA team that defines testing strategy
- Your product doesn't require high reliability (internal tools, prototypes)

## Your Task

Create comprehensive testing strategy including:
- Testing philosophy (why we test, what we test)
- Unit testing strategy (scope, patterns, coverage)
- Integration testing strategy (API, database, services)
- E2E testing strategy (critical paths, user flows)
- Testing frameworks and tools (from tech stack)
- Test coverage goals and quality gates
- CI/CD integration (when tests run, blocking vs non-blocking)
- Test data management (fixtures, factories, seeding)
- Performance testing (load, stress, benchmark)
- Security testing (auth, authorization, vulnerabilities)
- Testing workflows (TDD, BDD, regression)

---

## Process

### Step 1: Read Previous Outputs

**Required inputs:**

```
Read: product-guidelines/00-user-journey.md
Read: product-guidelines/02-tech-stack.md
Read: product-guidelines/04-architecture.md
Read: product-guidelines/07-database-schema-essentials.md (from Session 7)
Read: product-guidelines/08-api-contracts-essentials.md (from Session 8)
```

**Context Optimization**: We read essentials versions for significant context reduction:
- `07-database-schema-essentials.md` (~56% smaller) - Contains table list, ERD, relationships sufficient for test planning
- `08-api-contracts-essentials.md` (~80% smaller) - Contains endpoint list organized by journey step, sufficient for test coverage planning

**Optional inputs (if available):**

```
Read: product-guidelines/10-backlog/BACKLOG.md (if exists - backlog comes after test strategy in Session 10)
Read: product-guidelines/12-project-scaffold.md (if exists - scaffold comes after in Session 12)
```

**Extract from Journey**:
- What are the critical path operations? (These need highest test coverage)
- What user actions MUST work reliably? (These need E2E tests)
- What are the edge cases in the user flow? (These need specific test cases)
- Where is data entered by users? (These need validation testing)

**Extract from Tech Stack**:
- Frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte) → Component testing tools
- Backend framework (FastAPI, Express, Django) → API testing tools
- Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) → Integration test setup
- Testing tools already chosen (Jest, Pytest, Cypress, Playwright)
- CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI)

**Extract from Architecture**:
- System boundaries (what needs integration tests?)
- External dependencies (what needs mocking/stubbing?)
- Performance requirements (what needs performance tests?)
- Security requirements (what needs security tests?)

**Extract from Backlog (if available)**:
- What features are P0? (These need tests first)
- What features are complex? (These need more test coverage)
- What features handle critical data? (These need thorough testing)
- Note: Backlog is generated AFTER this session, so focus on journey and architecture if backlog doesn't exist yet

**Example (from compliance-saas):**
- Journey critical path: Upload document → Select frameworks → View assessment → Share report
- Tech stack: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), PostgreSQL (database), Pytest, Playwright
- Architecture: Multi-tenant, async processing, RESTful API
- P0 features: Document upload, AI assessment, results display
- Critical: Document processing must be reliable (customer's compliance depends on it)

---

### Step 2: Define Testing Philosophy

**Decision Tree - Testing Philosophy:**

```
What's your testing approach?

1. What's the product risk level?
   ├─ High risk (financial, healthcare, compliance) → Extensive testing (80%+ coverage)
   ├─ Medium risk (SaaS, e-commerce) → Pragmatic testing (60-80% coverage)
   └─ Low risk (internal tools, MVPs) → Essential testing (40-60% coverage)

2. What's your testing mindset?
   ├─ TDD (Test-Driven Development) → Write tests before code
   ├─ BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) → Write tests as user scenarios
   └─ Pragmatic → Write tests for critical paths, add as needed

3. What's your quality gate philosophy?
   ├─ No failing tests ever → All tests block CI/CD
   ├─ Critical tests only → Unit/integration tests block, E2E tests warn
   └─ Fast feedback → Fast tests block, slow tests run async
```

**Example testing philosophy (compliance-saas):**

```
Risk Level: HIGH (customers depend on accurate compliance assessments)
Approach: Pragmatic TDD with 70% coverage target
Quality Gates: All unit/integration tests must pass, E2E tests block production

Philosophy:
1. Test what matters: Critical path, data accuracy, security
2. Unit test business logic: Assessment algorithms, validation rules
3. Integration test external dependencies: AI API, file processing
4. E2E test user journeys: Complete flows from upload to report
5. Performance test bottlenecks: Document processing, concurrent assessments
6. Security test boundaries: Auth, authorization, data isolation
```

---

### Step 3: Define Unit Testing Strategy

**Decision Tree - Unit Testing Scope:**

```
What should be unit tested?

1. Business logic (ALWAYS)
   ├─ Calculations, algorithms, transformations
   ├─ Validation rules, business rules
   └─ Pure functions (input → output, no side effects)

2. Utilities and helpers (ALWAYS)
   ├─ String formatting, data parsing
   ├─ Date calculations, currency formatting
   └─ Custom validators, converters

3. Component logic (SELECTIVE)
   ├─ YES: Complex state management, conditional rendering
   ├─ NO: Simple presentational components
   └─ Use component tests for user interactions

4. What NOT to unit test
   ├─ Framework code (React, FastAPI internals)
   ├─ External libraries (axios, lodash)
   ├─ Simple getters/setters
   └─ Configuration files
```

**Example unit testing strategy:**

```yaml
# Unit Test Coverage Targets (compliance-saas)

Backend (Python/FastAPI):
  - Assessment scoring algorithm: 100% (critical business logic)
  - Framework mapping logic: 100% (accuracy critical)
  - Document parser: 90% (handles various formats)
  - Validation rules: 100% (prevent invalid data)
  - API route handlers: 60% (test logic, not framework)
  - Database models: 40% (test custom methods only)

Frontend (React):
  - Assessment result calculations: 100% (display accuracy)
  - Form validation: 100% (prevent bad inputs)
  - State management (Zustand): 80% (complex state logic)
  - React components: 50% (focus on complex components)
  - UI utilities: 80% (formatting, helpers)

Unit Test Patterns:
  - Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
  - One assertion per test (mostly - allow related assertions)
  - Test file co-located with source: `assessment.py` → `assessment.test.py`
  - Descriptive test names: `test_assessment_score_calculates_correctly_for_gdpr`
  - Use fixtures/factories for test data
  - Mock external dependencies (AI API, file storage)

Tools (from tech stack):
  - Backend: Pytest + pytest-asyncio + pytest-cov
  - Frontend: Vitest + Testing Library + MSW (mocking)
  - Coverage reporting: Codecov / Coveralls
  - Coverage threshold: 70% overall, 90% for critical modules
```

**Example unit test (backend):**

```python
# tests/test_assessment.py
import pytest
from app.assessment import calculate_compliance_score

def test_compliance_score_perfect_match():
    """Test score calculation when document matches all requirements"""
    requirements = ["encryption", "access_control", "audit_logs"]
    findings = ["encryption", "access_control", "audit_logs"]

    score = calculate_compliance_score(requirements, findings)

    assert score == 100

def test_compliance_score_partial_match():
    """Test score calculation when document misses some requirements"""
    requirements = ["encryption", "access_control", "audit_logs"]
    findings = ["encryption", "access_control"]  # Missing audit_logs

    score = calculate_compliance_score(requirements, findings)

    assert score == 67  # 2/3 = 67%

def test_compliance_score_empty_requirements():
    """Test score calculation when framework has no requirements"""
    requirements = []
    findings = []

    score = calculate_compliance_score(requirements, findings)

    assert score == 100  # Nothing required = perfect compliance
```

**Example unit test (frontend):**

```typescript
// src/components/AssessmentResults.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { AssessmentResults } from './AssessmentResults';

describe('AssessmentResults', () => {
  it('displays score with correct color for high compliance', () => {
    render(<AssessmentResults score={85} findings={[]} />);

    const scoreElement = screen.getByText('85%');
    expect(scoreElement).toHaveClass('text-green-600');
  });

  it('displays score with correct color for low compliance', () => {
    render(<AssessmentResults score={45} findings={[]} />);

    const scoreElement = screen.getByText('45%');
    expect(scoreElement).toHaveClass('text-red-600');
  });

  it('lists all findings with severity indicators', () => {
    const findings = [
      { issue: 'Missing encryption', severity: 'high' },
      { issue: 'Weak passwords', severity: 'medium' }
    ];

    render(<AssessmentResults score={70} findings={findings} />);

    expect(screen.getByText('Missing encryption')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('Weak passwords')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

---

### Step 4: Define Integration Testing Strategy

**Decision Tree - Integration Testing Scope:**

```
What needs integration testing?

1. External service integrations (ALWAYS)
   ├─ AI/ML APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic)
   ├─ Payment processors (Stripe, PayPal)
   ├─ Email services (SendGrid, Resend)
   └─ File storage (S3, Cloudinary)

2. Database operations (SELECTIVE)
   ├─ YES: Complex queries, transactions, relationships
   ├─ YES: Data integrity constraints
   ├─ NO: Simple CRUD (covered by unit tests with mocks)

3. API endpoints (ALWAYS)
   ├─ Request validation
   ├─ Response format
   ├─ Authentication/authorization
   └─ Error handling

4. Inter-service communication (if microservices)
   ├─ Service-to-service APIs
   ├─ Message queues (RabbitMQ, Redis)
   └─ Event publishers/subscribers
```

**Example integration testing strategy:**

```yaml
# Integration Test Coverage (compliance-saas)

API Integration Tests:
  - Document upload endpoint: Test multipart/form-data handling
  - Assessment creation: Test async job creation + status polling
  - Results retrieval: Test pagination, filtering, authorization
  - Public report sharing: Test token generation + public access
  - Authentication: Test JWT validation, session handling
  - Rate limiting: Test per-user/team limits

Database Integration Tests:
  - Multi-tenant data isolation: User A can't see User B's documents
  - Cascading deletes: Deleting team deletes all related data
  - Transaction handling: Failed assessment doesn't corrupt data
  - Query performance: Test N+1 query prevention
  - Unique constraints: Email uniqueness, framework name uniqueness

External Service Integration Tests:
  - AI API integration: Mock responses, test retry logic
  - File storage (S3): Upload, download, signed URLs
  - Email service: Test email sending (use test mode)

Integration Test Setup:
  - Test database: Separate PostgreSQL instance (Docker)
  - Database migrations: Run before tests, clean after
  - Test data: Use factories (FactoryBoy) for realistic data
  - External APIs: Use mocks (responses library) or test mode
  - Isolation: Each test gets clean database state

Tools (from tech stack):
  - Backend: Pytest + TestClient (FastAPI) + SQLAlchemy fixtures
  - API testing: httpx + pytest-asyncio
  - Database: pytest-postgresql or Docker + test migrations
  - Mocking: responses (Python) / MSW (JavaScript)
```

**Example integration test (API):**

```python
# tests/integration/test_document_api.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app
from app.database import get_db

client = TestClient(app)

@pytest.fixture
def authenticated_user(test_db):
    """Create test user and return auth token"""
    # Create user in test database
    user = create_test_user(email="test@example.com")
    token = generate_jwt_token(user.id)
    return {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}

def test_upload_document_success(authenticated_user):
    """Test document upload with authentication"""
    with open("tests/fixtures/sample.pdf", "rb") as f:
        response = client.post(
            "/api/documents",
            files={"file": ("sample.pdf", f, "application/pdf")},
            headers=authenticated_user
        )

    assert response.status_code == 201
    data = response.json()
    assert data["name"] == "sample.pdf"
    assert data["status"] == "processing"
    assert "id" in data

def test_upload_document_unauthorized():
    """Test document upload fails without authentication"""
    with open("tests/fixtures/sample.pdf", "rb") as f:
        response = client.post(
            "/api/documents",
            files={"file": ("sample.pdf", f, "application/pdf")}
        )

    assert response.status_code == 401

def test_list_documents_shows_only_user_documents(authenticated_user, test_db):
    """Test multi-tenant isolation: users see only their documents"""
    # Create documents for user A (authenticated)
    create_test_document(user_id=1, name="User A Doc")
    # Create documents for user B (different user)
    create_test_document(user_id=2, name="User B Doc")

    response = client.get("/api/documents", headers=authenticated_user)

    assert response.status_code == 200
    documents = response.json()["data"]
    assert len(documents) == 1
    assert documents[0]["name"] == "User A Doc"
```

---

### Step 5: Define E2E Testing Strategy

**Decision Tree - E2E Testing Scope:**

```
What needs E2E testing?

1. Critical user journeys (ALWAYS)
   ├─ Journey Step 1-3 (core value delivery)
   ├─ Authentication flow (signup, login, logout)
   └─ Payment flow (if monetized)

2. Happy paths (ALWAYS)
   ├─ Test complete flows start to finish
   └─ One E2E test per major user journey

3. Error scenarios (SELECTIVE)
   ├─ YES: Critical errors users will encounter
   ├─ NO: Edge cases (better in integration tests)

4. What NOT to E2E test
   ├─ Every UI state (too brittle, use component tests)
   ├─ Error handling (use integration tests)
   └─ Business logic (use unit tests)
```

**Example E2E testing strategy:**

```yaml
# E2E Test Coverage (compliance-saas)

Critical Journeys (from user journey steps 1-3):
  1. Complete compliance assessment flow:
     - User signs in
     - Uploads compliance document (PDF)
     - Selects frameworks (SOC2, GDPR)
     - Waits for assessment to complete
     - Views assessment results
     - Downloads report
     Expected: Full flow completes in <5 minutes

  2. Share report flow:
     - User completes assessment (use test account with pre-created assessment)
     - Clicks "Share Report"
     - Generates public link
     - Opens link in incognito (verify public access)
     - Verifies report displays correctly
     Expected: Public report accessible without authentication

  3. Team collaboration flow:
     - Team admin invites new user
     - New user accepts invitation
     - New user sees team's documents
     - New user creates assessment
     - Team admin sees new assessment in team view
     Expected: Multi-user collaboration works

E2E Test Patterns:
  - Page Object Model: Encapsulate page interactions
  - Test data: Use seeded test data or factories
  - Idempotent tests: Each test cleans up after itself
  - Stable selectors: Use data-testid, not CSS classes
  - Wait strategies: Wait for API responses, not arbitrary timeouts
  - Visual regression: Capture screenshots for visual changes

Test Execution:
  - Run on: Staging environment (production-like)
  - Frequency: Every PR (blocking), nightly (full suite)
  - Parallelization: Run tests in parallel (3-5 workers)
  - Retries: Retry flaky tests once (then investigate)
  - Timeouts: 30s per test, 5min per suite

Tools (from tech stack):
  - E2E framework: Playwright (cross-browser support)
  - Visual regression: Percy / Chromatic (optional)
  - Test data: Factories + database seeding
  - CI integration: GitHub Actions (matrix strategy for browsers)
```

**Example E2E test:**

```typescript
// tests/e2e/assessment-flow.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('complete assessment flow', async ({ page }) => {
  // Step 1: Sign in
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="email-input"]', 'test@example.com');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="password-input"]', 'password123');
  await page.click('[data-testid="login-button"]');

  // Wait for redirect to dashboard
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');

  // Step 2: Upload document
  await page.click('[data-testid="upload-button"]');
  const fileInput = await page.locator('input[type="file"]');
  await fileInput.setInputFiles('tests/fixtures/privacy-policy.pdf');

  // Wait for upload to complete
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="upload-success"]')).toBeVisible();

  // Step 3: Select frameworks
  await page.click('[data-testid="framework-gdpr"]');
  await page.click('[data-testid="framework-soc2"]');
  await page.click('[data-testid="start-assessment"]');

  // Step 4: Wait for assessment to complete (poll for status)
  await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="assessment-complete"]', {
    timeout: 60000 // 60 seconds max
  });

  // Step 5: Verify results displayed
  const score = await page.locator('[data-testid="compliance-score"]').textContent();
  expect(score).toMatch(/\d+%/); // Score displayed as percentage

  // Step 6: Download report
  const downloadPromise = page.waitForEvent('download');
  await page.click('[data-testid="download-report"]');
  const download = await downloadPromise;
  expect(download.suggestedFilename()).toContain('compliance-report');
});

test('share report publicly', async ({ page, context }) => {
  // Use pre-seeded assessment for faster test
  await page.goto('/assessments/test-assessment-id');

  // Generate public link
  await page.click('[data-testid="share-button"]');
  const publicLink = await page.locator('[data-testid="public-link"]').textContent();

  // Open link in incognito (new context = no cookies)
  const incognitoPage = await context.newPage();
  await incognitoPage.goto(publicLink);

  // Verify report loads without authentication
  await expect(incognitoPage.locator('[data-testid="report-title"]')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(incognitoPage.locator('[data-testid="login-prompt"]')).not.toBeVisible();
});
```

---

### Step 6: Define Test Coverage and Quality Gates

**Decision Tree - Coverage Targets:**

```
What's the right coverage target?

1. Product risk level
   ├─ High risk (financial, healthcare, compliance) → 80%+ coverage
   ├─ Medium risk (SaaS, e-commerce) → 60-80% coverage
   └─ Low risk (internal tools, MVPs) → 40-60% coverage

2. Code criticality
   ├─ Business logic, algorithms → 90-100% coverage
   ├─ API handlers, services → 70-80% coverage
   ├─ Database models, utilities → 50-70% coverage
   └─ UI components, views → 40-60% coverage

3. What coverage measures
   ├─ Line coverage: % of lines executed (common)
   ├─ Branch coverage: % of if/else branches tested (better)
   ├─ Function coverage: % of functions called
   └─ Mutation coverage: % of code changes caught by tests (advanced)
```

**Example test coverage strategy:**

```yaml
# Test Coverage Targets (compliance-saas)

Overall Coverage Goal: 70%

Coverage by Component:
  - Assessment engine: 95% (critical business logic)
  - API routes: 80% (high user interaction)
  - Database queries: 70% (data integrity)
  - UI components: 50% (focus on complex components)
  - Utilities: 80% (reused across app)

Coverage by Test Type:
  - Unit tests: 60% coverage of codebase
  - Integration tests: 20% coverage (overlap with unit tests)
  - E2E tests: 10% coverage (critical paths only)

Quality Gates:
  1. All unit tests pass (blocking)
  2. All integration tests pass (blocking)
  3. Coverage >= 70% (blocking)
  4. No decrease in coverage vs main branch (blocking)
  5. E2E tests pass (blocking on main, warning on PR)
  6. No high/critical security vulnerabilities (blocking)
  7. Performance tests pass (non-blocking, informational)

CI/CD Integration:
  - On PR: Run unit + integration tests (< 5 min)
  - On PR: Run E2E smoke tests (5-10 min)
  - On merge to main: Run full E2E suite (20-30 min)
  - Nightly: Run full suite + performance tests (1-2 hours)
  - Before production deploy: Run full suite (required)

Coverage Reporting:
  - Tool: Codecov / Coveralls
  - Report format: HTML (for local), JSON (for CI)
  - Coverage badge: Display in README
  - Coverage trends: Track over time, alert on decreases
```

---

### Step 7: Define Test Data Management

**Decision Tree - Test Data Strategy:**

```
How to manage test data?

1. Test isolation strategy
   ├─ Fresh database per test (slow but isolated)
   ├─ Transactions + rollback (fast, requires discipline)
   └─ Database snapshots (fast, requires setup)

2. Test data creation
   ├─ Fixtures: Pre-defined data (JSON, SQL)
   ├─ Factories: Generate data programmatically (recommended)
   └─ Shared test database: Pre-seeded (fast but shared state)

3. Realistic vs minimal data
   ├─ Minimal: Just enough to test (faster)
   ├─ Realistic: Production-like data (better coverage)
   └─ Hybrid: Minimal for unit, realistic for integration/E2E
```

**Example test data management:**

```yaml
# Test Data Strategy (compliance-saas)

Test Database Setup:
  - Local testing: Docker PostgreSQL (test database)
  - CI testing: PostgreSQL service (GitHub Actions)
  - Database per test suite: pytest-postgresql fixtures
  - Migrations: Run migrations before each test suite
  - Cleanup: Truncate tables after each test class

Test Data Creation:
  - Use factories (FactoryBoy for Python, Fishery for TypeScript)
  - Generate realistic data (Faker library)
  - Minimal data for unit tests (1-2 records)
  - Realistic data for integration/E2E tests (10-20 records)

Example Factory (Python):
  ```python
  # tests/factories.py
  import factory
  from app.models import User, Document, Assessment

  class UserFactory(factory.Factory):
      class Meta:
          model = User

      id = factory.Sequence(lambda n: f"user_{n}")
      email = factory.Faker('email')
      name = factory.Faker('name')
      team_id = factory.LazyAttribute(lambda _: create_team().id)

  class DocumentFactory(factory.Factory):
      class Meta:
          model = Document

      id = factory.Sequence(lambda n: f"doc_{n}")
      name = factory.Faker('file_name', extension='pdf')
      file_size = factory.Faker('random_int', min=1000, max=5000000)
      status = "ready"
      user_id = factory.LazyAttribute(lambda _: UserFactory().id)
  ```

Example Factory Usage:
  ```python
  # tests/test_assessment.py
  def test_create_assessment():
      # Create test data with factories
      user = UserFactory()
      document = DocumentFactory(user_id=user.id)
      frameworks = [FrameworkFactory() for _ in range(2)]

      # Test assessment creation
      assessment = create_assessment(
          document_id=document.id,
          framework_ids=[f.id for f in frameworks]
      )

      assert assessment.status == "pending"
  ```

Test Data Files:
  - Fixtures location: tests/fixtures/
  - Sample documents: tests/fixtures/sample.pdf, tests/fixtures/policy.docx
  - API responses: tests/fixtures/api-responses/ (for mocking)
  - Database seeds: tests/fixtures/seeds.sql (for E2E tests)

Test Data Cleanup:
  - After each test: Truncate tables or rollback transaction
  - After test suite: Drop test database
  - CI cleanup: Delete test database after job
```

---

### Step 8: Define Performance and Security Testing

**Performance Testing Strategy:**

```yaml
# Performance Testing (compliance-saas)

Load Testing:
  - Tool: Locust / k6 / Artillery
  - Scenarios:
    1. Document upload: 10 concurrent users, 100 uploads/min
    2. Assessment status polling: 50 concurrent users, 500 requests/min
    3. Results retrieval: 20 concurrent users, 200 requests/min
  - Success criteria:
    - p95 latency < 500ms (API responses)
    - p99 latency < 2s (API responses)
    - 0% error rate under normal load
    - < 5% error rate under 2x load

Stress Testing:
  - Ramp up users until system breaks
  - Find breaking point (max concurrent users)
  - Document failure mode (graceful degradation?)
  - Success criteria:
    - System handles 2x expected load
    - System fails gracefully (returns 503, not 500)

Benchmark Testing:
  - Critical operations:
    - Document parsing: < 5s for 10MB PDF
    - AI assessment: < 60s for typical document
    - Report generation: < 2s for any assessment
  - Run before/after performance changes
  - Track performance over time

Performance Test Execution:
  - Frequency: Weekly (staging environment)
  - Before production deploy: Run load tests
  - After performance optimization: Run benchmarks
  - CI integration: Optional (long-running)
```

**Security Testing Strategy:**

```yaml
# Security Testing (compliance-saas)

Authentication Testing:
  - Test invalid tokens (expired, malformed, wrong signature)
  - Test token expiration and refresh
  - Test password strength requirements
  - Test rate limiting on login endpoint

Authorization Testing:
  - Test user can't access other users' data (multi-tenant isolation)
  - Test role-based access (admin vs regular user)
  - Test API endpoints require authentication
  - Test public endpoints don't leak private data

Input Validation Testing:
  - Test SQL injection (parameterized queries prevent)
  - Test XSS (input sanitization)
  - Test file upload validation (PDF/DOCX only, size limits)
  - Test API input validation (400 for invalid data)

Dependency Scanning:
  - Tool: Snyk / Dependabot / npm audit
  - Frequency: Daily (CI)
  - Action: Create GitHub issue for vulnerabilities
  - Blocking: High/critical vulnerabilities block deploy

SAST (Static Application Security Testing):
  - Tool: Semgrep / Bandit (Python) / ESLint security plugin (JS)
  - Frequency: Every PR
  - Checks: Hardcoded secrets, SQL injection patterns, XSS

DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):
  - Tool: OWASP ZAP / Burp Suite
  - Frequency: Weekly (staging environment)
  - Checks: Authentication bypasses, injection attacks, misconfigurations

Security Test Execution:
  - On PR: Dependency scan + SAST (< 2 min)
  - Weekly: DAST scan (30-60 min)
  - Before deploy: All security tests pass
```

### Step 9: Define Testing Workflows

**Testing Workflow (TDD Example):**

```
Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow:

1. Write failing test
   - Define expected behavior
   - Write test that fails (Red)

2. Write minimal code to pass test
   - Implement just enough to pass (Green)
   - Don't over-engineer

3. Refactor
   - Clean up code
   - Tests still pass (Green)

4. Repeat for next feature

Example TDD workflow (compliance assessment):
  1. Write test: test_assessment_calculates_score()
     - Input: document + framework
     - Expected: score = 85%

  2. Run test → FAIL (function doesn't exist)

  3. Implement calculate_score() function
     - Simple implementation

  4. Run test → PASS

  5. Refactor: Extract helper functions, add comments

  6. Run test → PASS

  7. Next test: test_assessment_handles_missing_requirements()
```

**Regression Testing Workflow:**

```
Regression Testing: Prevent old bugs from coming back

1. Bug discovered in production
   - User reports compliance score incorrect

2. Write test reproducing bug
   - test_compliance_score_handles_empty_sections()
   - Test FAILS (reproduces bug)

3. Fix bug
   - Update calculate_score() function

4. Test PASSES
   - Bug fixed

5. Test remains in suite
   - Prevents regression (bug coming back)

Regression test management:
  - Never delete regression tests
  - Tag tests with issue numbers (test_issue_123)
  - Run full regression suite before releases
```

- Testing philosophy and principles
- Test types and coverage targets
- Testing tools and frameworks
- Test execution workflows
- Test data management
- CI/CD integration
- Performance and security testing
- "What We DIDN'T Choose" section

**Template structure:**

## What We DIDN'T Choose (And Why)

### 100% Test Coverage

**What it is**: Requiring every line of code to be tested

**Why not (for this journey)**:
- **Diminishing returns** - Last 20% takes 80% of effort
- **Coverage doesn't equal quality** - 100% coverage can still have bugs
- **Slows development** - Testing every getter/setter is wasteful
- **Journey focus** - Better to test critical paths thoroughly than everything superficially

**When to reconsider**:
- IF building safety-critical system (medical devices, aviation)
- IF regulatory requirement (some finance/healthcare)
- IF legacy system with lots of bugs (increase coverage gradually)

**Example**: Financial trading system needs 100% coverage (money at stake). SaaS compliance tool needs 70% coverage focused on critical paths.

---

### Testing Every UI State

**What it is**: Unit testing every possible UI state and combination

**Why not (for this journey)**:
- **UI changes frequently** - Tests become maintenance burden
- **Brittle tests** - Break with minor CSS/layout changes
- **Better alternatives** - E2E tests cover user flows, visual regression tests catch UI changes
- **Journey focus** - Test user interactions, not implementation details

**When to reconsider**:
- IF complex state management (30+ UI states)
- IF design system library (UI is the product)
- IF regulatory requirement (accessibility testing)

**Example**: Complex data visualization with 50 states - test state logic with unit tests, test rendering with visual regression. Simple CRUD app - use E2E tests for user flows.

---

### Mutation Testing

**What it is**: Automatically modify code to verify tests catch changes

**Why not (for this journey)**:
- **Slow** - Mutation testing is very slow (10x-100x longer)
- **Diminishing returns** - Finds edge cases, but high effort
- **Pragmatic focus** - Better to test critical paths well
- **Journey stage** - More useful for mature products, not MVP

**When to reconsider**:
- IF safety-critical system (catch all bugs)
- IF stable codebase (not changing much)
- IF have time/resources (mature product phase)

**Example**: Medical device firmware - mutation testing catches subtle bugs. SaaS MVP - focus on critical path coverage first.

---

### Property-Based Testing

**What it is**: Generate random inputs to test properties (e.g., "sorting always returns sorted list")

**Why not (for this journey)**:
- **Complexity** - Harder to write and understand
- **Overkill for CRUD** - Most web apps have predictable inputs
- **Edge case focus** - Better for algorithms/libraries, less for business logic
- **Team expertise** - Requires learning new testing paradigm

**When to reconsider**:
- IF complex algorithms (parsers, compilers, data processing)
- IF many edge cases (date handling, currency conversion)
- IF team experienced with property-based testing

**Example**: PDF parser with many edge cases - property-based testing finds weird inputs. Simple REST API - example-based tests are sufficient.

---

### Full E2E Test Suite on Every PR

**What it is**: Run all E2E tests on every pull request

**Why not (for this journey)**:
- **Too slow** - E2E tests take 20-30 minutes, slows feedback
- **Expensive** - CI minutes cost money
- **Overkill** - Most PRs don't affect entire user flow
- **Pragmatic approach** - Run smoke tests on PR, full suite on merge

**When to reconsider**:
- IF E2E tests are fast (< 5 minutes)
- IF high bug rate (need more testing)
- IF few PRs per day (can afford time)

**Example**: 50 PRs/day with 30-min E2E suite = 25 hours CI time/day (expensive). Run E2E smoke tests (5 min) on PR, full suite on merge to main.

---

### Visual Regression Testing for Every Component

**What it is**: Screenshot every component and detect visual changes

**Why not (for this journey)**:
- **Maintenance burden** - Every design change requires updating screenshots
- **False positives** - Flaky tests due to timing, fonts, rendering
- **Expensive** - Visual regression services cost money (Percy, Chromatic)
- **Selective approach** - Test critical components only

**When to reconsider**:
- IF design system library (UI is the product)
- IF frequent visual bugs (lack of design discipline)
- IF large team (many contributors, need consistency)

**Example**: Design system with 100 components - visual regression catches unintended changes. Small SaaS app - manual QA + E2E tests are sufficient.

---

### Test Parallelization with 10+ Workers

**What it is**: Run tests across many parallel workers for speed

**Why not (for this journey)**:
- **Diminishing returns** - 3-5 workers is sweet spot, more doesn't help much
- **Resource limits** - CI environments have CPU/memory limits
- **Database contention** - More workers = more database connections
- **Complexity** - Requires careful test isolation

**When to reconsider**:
- IF massive test suite (>1000 tests, >1 hour)
- IF have resources (self-hosted CI with many CPUs)
- IF tests are well-isolated (no shared state)

**Example**: 1000 E2E tests taking 2 hours - parallelize with 10 workers. 100 tests taking 10 minutes - 3-5 workers is enough.
